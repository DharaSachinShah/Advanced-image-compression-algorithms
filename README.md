Image compression is crucial for reducing the size of digital images, enabling efficient storage and transmission. JPEG, a widely used lossy compression method, reduces image file sizes by discarding less important data while maintaining visual quality. The problem statement revolves around constructing a pipeline that compresses and decompresses grayscale images, evaluates the trade-off between image quality and compression ratio, and compares the results with other standard implementations. This project involves developing a JPEG-like compression engine for grayscale images, with a focus on accuracy and performance evaluation using RMSE versus BPP, while utilizing the key components of the JPEG standard: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and Huffman encoding. Thealgorithm’s performance (which also includes reconstructing the compressed image) will be tested by varying quality factors and analyzing compression efficiency.
Additionally, the project explores advanced image compression techniques, inspired by the research paper ”Edge-Based Image Compression with Homogeneous Diffusion” by Mainberger and Weickert. This approach leverages partial differential equations (PDEs) to preserve edges through homogeneous diffusion, addressing the limitations of block-based methods like JPEG.
The study aims to compare traditional JPEG methods with PDE-based techniques, highlighting their effectiveness in preserving image details and achieving superior compression for specific image classes. By bridging traditional and modern methods, this project seeks to improve compression efficiency for diverse applications.
The goal of this project is to develop a compression engine based on the JPEG standard, simulate different quality factors, and analyze the performance in terms of image quality degradation (measured using RMSE) and compression efficiency (measured using Bits Per Pixel, BPP).
